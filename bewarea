overview 
The bwarea function in Octave estimates the area of an object in a binary image
based on the contribution of diﬀerent fields of diﬀerent pixel patterns. It not only
counts 1 pixel, but also uses a weighting method to improve the accuracy of field
measurements. This is an implementation of the octave function in scilab for
calculating area and also padding images
