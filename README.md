Scilab Image Processing Toolbox & Function Development
Welcome to the Scilab Image Processing Toolbox & Development Repo!
This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of essential image processing functions in Scilab, aimed at extending and enhancing Scilab's native capabilities for academic, research, and practical use.

âœ¨ What's Inside?
This repository includes Scilab implementations of commonly used image processing functions, such as:

ðŸ§® bwarea â€“ Calculates the area of binary images using 2D convolution and pixel configuration detection.

ðŸŒˆ rgb2xyz â€“ Converts RGB images or values to the CIE XYZ color space using the D65 illuminant standard.

ðŸ§° imapplymatrix â€“ Applies a 3Ã—3 transformation matrix to an image or set of color channels.

Each function is carefully documented and includes example test scripts or usage demonstrations to help you get started.

ðŸ§  Purpose
This project aims to:

Provide a foundational toolbox for Scilab users interested in image processing.

Help students and developers understand the inner workings of common image processing algorithms.

Contribute to the open-source Scilab ecosystem by implementing missing or custom functions.

ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This repository is actively maintained and under development. More functions, test cases, and documentation will be added soon!
